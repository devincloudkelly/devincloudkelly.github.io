Devin Cloud Kelly is a Chicago-based email developer and former e-commerce entrepreneur. After working in marketing and e-commerce left him unsatisfied, he decided to pursue a career where he could creatively problem-solve every day and attended Flatiron's Software Engineering program in 2019.

Coming from a non-technical background, Devin shamelessly admits what he doesn't know and enjoys digging in to learn more every day. The title of this blog came from his (former) lack of understanding for how UI design mock-ups work and is a great reminder to stay humble as we're all lifelong students. He enjoys helping others by sharing his knowledge to help others get over technical roadblocks and understand some of the concepts that previously stumped him. 

When he isn't coding, Devin enjoys spending time with his wife and family, being outdoors, cooking, and perfecting his latte art. If you can have any latte art tips, please email me at [devin.cloud.kelly@gmail.com](mailto:devin.cloud.kelly@gmail.com). I need all the help I can get.
